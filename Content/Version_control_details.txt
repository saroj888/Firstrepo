a.txt and b.txt file are created in the local machine and to add them 
in the repository 

We need to init the repository (git  init) to create a empty repository in workspace.

the command is add the files to repository is ( git add a.txt b.txt ) 
Thereafter use (git status) is used to check if they are in the repository or not.
This will basically show the untracked files (they are in local machine but not in staging and repository).

Now we need to commit the files.
So we need to config some required details.(email ,username):

git config --global user.email "sarojgope3425@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "saroj"

So now we can commit .
Here we need a comment to commit.
git commit -m "this is my first commit"
check (git status)

git log (This will show how many commit have you done earlier).

Agar kuch file me changes kiye ho to local repository me saved nahi honji
so first add them and do commit.  (git commit -a -m "both are modified").

Working Directory  ----------------> Stagging --------------------->            Local Repository    ------------->  Remote Repository
(Your working space)            (Before commiting put them in stagging area)    (Commit them )                        (Push them into remote repository)


vim index.txt (Ek text editor will open and write the details.) ==> This is in working directory
git init (Initilize a empty git repository)
git add .  (It will be updated in stagging area)
git status  (commited)

REQ1 : To see the difference between Working Area and Staging Area ?
